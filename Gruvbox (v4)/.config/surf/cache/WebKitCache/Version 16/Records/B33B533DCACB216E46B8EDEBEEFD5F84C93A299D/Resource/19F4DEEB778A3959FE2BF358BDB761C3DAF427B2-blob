      <h3>About Us</h3>
      <p> The creator of VentChat was inspired to make it for two reasons, one being the frightening increase in mental health issues around the world,
        and two being his own need to talk about his issues without worrying about people taking advantage of that vulnerability. He knew he wanted to become a
        therapist and help people, but he also knew that the current model of therapeutic treatments would never meet the demands of people needing to express the
        problems they face. He believed one of the best ways to meet this demand was to provide an anonymous chatting service, with no strings or risks attached,
        easy access to talk to real people dealing with similar issues.</p>
